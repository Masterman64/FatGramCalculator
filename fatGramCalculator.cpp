/*
Fat Gram Calculator ï¿½ C++ p. 223
Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food.
The program should display the percentage of calories that come from fat.
If the calories from fat are less than 30% of the total calories of the food,
it should also display a message indicating that the food is low in fat.
One gram of fat has 9 calories, so

Calories from fat = fat grams * 9

The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as

Calories from fat / total calories
Input Validation: Make sure the number of calories and fat grams are not less than 0.
Also the number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories.
If that happens, display an error message indication that either the calories or fat grams were incorrectly entered.

//So to reiterate (and to make copy and pasting the assignment into my program less like cheeting),
//the program is asking the user to enter the amount of fat and the amount of calories in some food item.
//The program will take those values and calculate the percent of calories from fat.
//To do this, the program asks the user for the calories in the food and for the fat in the good.
//calories from fat is then calculated by taking fat in grams times 9. 
//then calories from fat is devided by the total calories found in the food given my user input.
//This gives the percent of calories from fat for the food.

//Equations are: calories from fat = fat grams * 9 and percent fat calories = calroires from fat / total calories

//The program cannot have less than 0 calories and the calories from fat cannot exceed the total calories.
//An error message needs to be displayed if it is out of range stating they were incorrectly entered.
//If there are less than 30% calories from fat, tell the user that.
